GIT_5 – Understanding git diff output

Explanation of the example diff:

- Lines starting with '-' show content removed from the old version.
- Lines starting with '+' show new content added in the new version.
- Unprefixed lines show unchanged context that helps understand where the changes occurred.
- The @@ -start,len +start,len @@ header indicates which line ranges differ between the old and new versions.
  - The first part (-start,len) shows the starting line and number of lines in the old file.
  - The second part (+start,len) shows the starting line and number of lines in the new file.

Example interpretation:
If you see:
@@ -5,3 +5,4 @@
- old line content
  unchanged context line
+ new line content

This means:
- Starting at line 5, the old version had 3 lines total in this section
- Starting at line 5, the new version has 4 lines total in this section
- One line was removed (marked with -)
- One line was added (marked with +)
- The context line remained unchanged
